Physics Abstraction Layer (PAL)
-------------------------------

CMake (>=2.6.2) is required to build PAL ( http://www.cmake.org ).
Run CMake and fill appropriate options and paths you find in the CMake cache, and configure until every variable has been set (Options generally have a description when not trivial).
When done, generate makefiles/project files and build accordingly.

Notes about finding dependencies:
- Some engines have a special variable used when finding them. You may change their value the very first time you encounter them (For instance ODE_DOUBLE_PRECISION, or BULLET_SINGLE_THREADED).
- You can add paths to PAL_ADDITIONAL_SEARCH_PATHS variable. This may help the finders modules to locate your dependencies.
- If you want the finders to restart their job about a given variable without clearing the whole cache, just set the variable to "NOTFOUND" and configure again.
- If a dependency is not found or not completely found (for instance you put it in a custom directory), you should enter manually the paths:
	- *_INCLUD_DIR (For instance ODE_INCLUD_DIR) points to the include directory, as you would set it in your compiler (/parent/mylib/include for instance).
	- *_LIBRARY and *_LIBRARY_DEBUG point to the ".lib" or ".a" used by the linker, respectively for releases (= all but debug) and debug configurations. If *_LIBRARY_DEBUG is not found, then the scripts will use the release library in debug configuration.
	- *_LIBRARY_MODULE and *_LIBRARY_MODULE_DEBUG are purely optional and point to the DLL/so equivalent of lib/a. Used only for automatic module copy. You may have to copy the modules to the right location or set your PATH accordingly if not set.
