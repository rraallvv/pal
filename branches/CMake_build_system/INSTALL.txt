Physics Abstraction Layer (PAL)
-------------------------------

CMake (>=2.6.2) is required to build PAL ( http://www.cmake.org ).
Run CMake. Select appropriate options and configure until every variable has been set (Options generally have a description when not trivial).
When done, generate makefiles/project files and build accordingly.

Please report anything useful to the forums ( http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=117016 ) on the PAL project page on SourceForge.net ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/pal ).
