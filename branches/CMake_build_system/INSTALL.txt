Physics Abstraction Layer (PAL)
-------------------------------

CMake (>=2.6.2) is required to build PAL. http://www.cmake.org
Run CMake and select appropriate options and configure. Options generally have a description when not trivial.
When done, generate makefiles/project files and build accordingly.
