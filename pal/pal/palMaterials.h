/** The Material definition structure.
   The use of the friction information is dependent on the phyisics implementation used.
   Friction is represented by the Coulomb model of friction.
   Static friction represents the ammount of friction in a material when an object first begins to move.
   Kinetic friction is the friction of a material for an object already in motion.
   Resitution is used to represent an elastic collision (ie: bounce), it is the height an object will bounce when droped onto a material.

/** The materials management class.
	This class allows you to add materials into the physics engine. The class maintains a library of all materials created and generates the appropriate underlying data structures. 
	A Material can be extracted from the Materials library using the GetMaterial() function.

	Friction is represented by the Coulomb model of friction.

	Kinetic friction is the friction of a material for an object already in motion.
	Resitution (elasticity) is used to represent an elastic collision (ie: bounce), it is the height an object will bounce when droped onto a material.

	\f[ c = \frac{s_2-v_2}{v_1-s_1} \f]

	Developer Notes:
	The materials management class employes the palMaterialInteraction and palMaterialUnique classes behind the scenes. 
	You should only need to implement the aforementioned classes.
